Playing PlayShib.fun Prediction lets you test your foresight to earn rewards. Use your market knowledge or gut feeling to predict if the BONE,  price will go up or down in the near future. Get it right and you’ll collect a share of the round’s prize pool!

To enter a round of Prediction, you'll want to check how long is left in the current round. You'll find the timer in the top-right area.

/>

If the timer is too low your prediction may not confirm in time, so check there's still plenty of time left before you make a prediction (30 seconds should be plenty, but give yourself more time if you're following along with this guide).

## Predicting the next round

When you're sure you have enough time, you can place your prediction for the next round:

1. In the "Next" section you'll see a green Enter UP button and a red Enter DOWN button. Click Enter UP if you want to predict a rise in price, and click Enter DOWN if you want to predict a drop in price.

/>

2. Each will have a different reward multiplier. The multiplier will change over time as the "Prize Pool" increases depending on people's predictions. The Prize Pool is shown just above the buttons.

3. A new window will open. In the window, you'll see "Commit" to commit BNB, ETH or CAKE for your prediction. Type the number of tokens you would like to commit to your prediction for this round in the field. You can also use the bunny slider or click the percent buttons if you prefer.

## Predicting the next round

A live round will last for 5 minutes. You can watch the price update during the 5 minutes if you'd like.

<img

  alt="Shibarium DAO Hero"
  style={{ width: '50%', maxWidth: '900px', display: 'block', margin: '40px auto 32px auto', borderRadius: '16px' }}
/>

You cannot change your prediction during a live round, however. You are locked into your prediction from earlier.

## Once your entered round finishes

After 5/10 minutes as the live round, your entered round will finish. Everything is automatic, so there's nothing you need to do to end the round.

### Seeing the results

- As the 5/10 minutes finish, the "LIVE" section will change to "Calculating". Calculating the results only takes a moment.

  style={{ width: '50%', maxWidth: '900px', display: 'block', margin: '40px auto 32px auto', borderRadius: '16px' }}
/>

- After a short wait, the finished round will move left and say "Ended". The result of the round will display with either UP colored in green, or DOWN colored in red.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '20px', margin: '40px auto 32px auto'}}>
