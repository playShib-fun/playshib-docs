Predict whether the price of BONE will go UP or DOWN in a 5-minute round
</Tip>

## How It Works:

- Predict whether the price of BONE will go UP or DOWN in a 5-minute round.
- Stake your BONE tokens on your prediction.
- If your prediction is correct when the round ends, you win a share of the prize pool!
- Collect your winnings at any time—you are never rushed.

## Ready to Start :

- Connect your wallet that holds BONE tokens.
- Check the countdown timer for the current round — make sure there's at least 30 seconds left before making your prediction.
- Choose Enter UP to predict the price will rise, or Enter DOWN to predict it will fall.
- Enter the amount of BONE you want to commit and confirm the transaction.
- Wait for the round to complete automatically.
- If you win, claim your winnings easily with the Collect Winnings button.

## Important Notes :

- Once you enter a prediction, it is locked in and cannot be changed or removed.
- A 5% treasury fee is applied to each round’s total pot to support the platform.
- Out of this fee, 2% of all BONE staked is permanently burned, reducing the total supply and creating deflationary pressure.
- The remaining 3% funds development, resources, and upkeep to ensure continued growth and reliability.
- Prize pools and multipliers dynamically adjust based on all users' predictions.
- Due to blockchain finalization, results may sometimes update a few seconds after the round ends.
