## General Questions - FQA



#### Is there a time limit before I can collect my winnings?
No, collect your winnings at any time.

#### How is the payout calculated?
- Payout Ratio for UP: Total Pool ÷ Amount Bet on UP
- Payout Ratio for DOWN:** Total Pool ÷ Amount Bet on DOWN
- Payout Amount: Payout Ratio × Your Bet × (1 - Treasury Fee)

##### Suppose you bet 8 BONE on the DOWN position.
- Total DOWN pool: 60 BONE
- Total UP pool: 90 BONE
- Total pool: 150 BONE
- Treasury fee: 5% (includes 2% burn and 3% platform fee)

##### Step 1: Calculate Payout Ratio
Payout Ratio = Total Pool ÷ DOWN Pool = 150 ÷ 60 = 2.5x

##### Step 2: Calculate Gross Payout
Gross Payout = Your Bet × Payout Ratio = 8 × 2.5 = 20 BONE

##### Step 3: Apply Treasury Fee (5%)
Net Payout = Gross Payout × (1 – 0.05) = 20 × 0.95 = 19 BONE

##### Step 4: Calculate Profit
Profit = Net Payout – Your Bet = 19 – 8 = 11 BONE

<Note>
Out of the 5% treasury fee, 2% of BONE is burned each round, reducing overall supply, while the remaining 3% supports platform development and resources.
</Note>

#### What are the fees?
5% of each round's total pot will go to the treasury. Out of this fee, 2% of all BONE staked is permanently burned, reducing the total supply and creating deflationary pressure.

#### The round's result changed after the round ended! Why?
Due to blockchain confirmation and data processing, final results may briefly update after the “live” round finishes.

#### Can I change or remove my position?
No. Once you confirm a prediction, it is locked in for that round.
